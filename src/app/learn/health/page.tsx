            <h3 id="composition-guide" className="text-xl font-medium mb-4">Comprehensive Guide to Carbonated Waters</h3>
            <p className="mb-6">
              The world of carbonated waters can be confusing, with terms like seltzer, sparkling water, and club soda often used interchangeably. However, each type has distinct characteristics that can affect both taste and health benefits. Understanding these differences is essential for choosing the right option for your needs.
            </p>
            
            <ul className="space-y-4 mb-6">
              <li>
                <strong>Seltzer Water</strong>: The simplest form of carbonated water, seltzer is plain water infused with carbon dioxide. While traditional seltzer contains no additives, the market now includes many flavored seltzer water options. These beverages maintain their health benefits as long as they're free from added sugars or artificial sweeteners. Many health-conscious consumers prefer seltzer as a pure, calorie-free option that can be easily made at home using a sparkling water maker.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Natural Sparkling Water</strong>: Sourced from mineral springs, natural sparkling water contains dissolved minerals that contribute to its unique taste profile and potential health benefits. These minerals, including calcium, magnesium, and bicarbonates, occur naturally and can vary significantly between brands. Some popular sparkling water brands enhance their products' natural carbonation while maintaining the original mineral content, offering a balance between authenticity and consistent fizz.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Club Soda</strong>: Unlike seltzer or natural sparkling water, club soda is engineered to include specific mineral salts. The addition of sodium bicarbonate, potassium sulfate, and other minerals gives club soda its characteristic taste and slight mineral tang. While these added minerals can contribute to daily nutrient intake, individuals monitoring their sodium intake should be aware of the higher mineral content.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Flavored Sparkling Water</strong>: The fastest-growing category in the carbonated water market, flavored sparkling waters come in two main varieties: those with natural flavors only and those with additional ingredients. Is flavored sparkling water healthy? The answer depends largely on the ingredients. Options with only natural flavors maintain the health benefits of plain sparkling water, while those with citric acid, artificial sweeteners, or other additives may require more careful consideration.
              </li>
