            <h2 id="science" className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">The Science Behind Carbonation</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              The delightful fizz of sparkling water comes from dissolved carbon dioxide (CO₂) gas in water under pressure. When CO₂ is forced into water under pressure, the gas molecules dissolve, creating carbonation. Once the pressure is released—such as when opening a bottle—the gas forms bubbles that rise to the surface, producing the characteristic effervescence. For a deeper dive into the fascinating chemistry and physics behind this process, check out our detailed guide on <a href="/learn/carbonation" className="text-primary hover:text-primary/80 underline">the history and science of carbonation</a>.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6">
              Colder water holds carbonation better because gases dissolve more readily in cold liquids. This is why pre-chilling your water before carbonation can lead to better, longer-lasting fizz. Understanding these fundamental principles will help you optimize your homemade sparkling water, whether using a commercial sparkling water maker or a DIY carbonation method.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6">
              Additionally, the pH of sparkling water is slightly lower than that of still water due to the formation of carbonic acid when CO₂ dissolves. This gives carbonated water its slightly tangy taste, making it more refreshing to drink. Some people worry about carbonation affecting dental health, but the risk is minimal compared to sugary sodas, especially if you consume plain sparkling water without added acids or sweeteners.
